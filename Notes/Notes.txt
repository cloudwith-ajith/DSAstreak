What is vector<int>?
In this problem, vector<int> is used to return multiple values (specifically, two integers) 
from the function passedBy()

C++ functions can only return one value directly. If you want to return two integers, you have three common choices:
Return a struct or pair
Modify arguments by reference (already used here)
Return a vector<int>, which can hold multiple integers
-----return std::pair<int,int>-----
You can return a std::pair<int, int> to return two integers from a function.
